SapporoAzureMok2 (札幌Azureもくもく会) is a community that targets Sapporo people to work on Azure issues in "MokuMoku" (Mokumoku means silence in Japanese).  
We host the monthly hybrid meeting. During the meeting, you can ask questions and talk with the attendees when you have trouble.  
You can register for our meetings and get notified about all our future events!
